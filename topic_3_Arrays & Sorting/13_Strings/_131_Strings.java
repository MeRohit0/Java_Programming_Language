/*
    Strings data type used to store string in memory location
    
    String can include characters , number and special characters also 
        like (a,b,c, asd,$5,533, sdf34@#$@$)
    
ðŸ“Œ NOTE : Strings are IMMUTABLE (its value cannot be changed once assign)

    Input/Output of string is done by Scanner / print function similar to int 

    String lenght() method is used to get length of string 

    concatenation of strings

    charAt() method is used to check character at the index 

    equals() method is used to check the value of String object rather then 
        objects are same unlike in == operator it check if they both are same object or not

ðŸ“Œ  NOTE: we should not use == operator to compare on the object reference they are same 
            this refers to same object that's why we should use equals() method for its value

    Explanation :

    It uses interning concept to store the only one instance of each string in intern pool,
    
    in java we have two type of memory stack and heap memory 
    while stack memory use for storing function call and variable and 
    heap memory is used for dynamic memory allocation during runtime of program 

    therefore in string we use the interning concept to store the value of 
    string and return the reference to the string variable to save memory
