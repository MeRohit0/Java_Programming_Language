/*
 *  Package is a group of similar types of classe, interfaces and sub-packages

    we have to use the package keyword to create the package 

    NOTE : we have to store them in the same directory as the package name 

    if we have to use the class we have to import the class using import 
        java.util.*  only the class will be access from package not sub-package
