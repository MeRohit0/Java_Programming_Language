/*
    Introduction to stack 
    in this data structure we only perform operation on the top most object (or element ) in the stack therefore 
    Stack follows LIFO principle (Last in First Out)

    we mainly perform 3 operations they all done in time complexity - O(1)
    1. push     TC - O(1)
    2. pop      TC - O(1)
    3. peek     TC - O(1)

    Stack can be implemented using the Arrays , ArrayList , Linkedlist

    Stack_AL is implementation using ArrayList
    Stack_LL is implemented using Linkedlist
